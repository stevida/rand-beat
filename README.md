# rand-beat
random drum sequencer programmed in max msp with two synthesizers 

each patch was recorded indiviudally using a common tempo and later edited in Logic

the drum sequencer takes in an array of pre-recorded. .wav sample files and chooses them at random,
with the kick always landing on the 1 and the snare on the 3,  with random quarter notes of silences programmed in
to emulate a groove
